									<h2>Technical Experience</h2>
									<p><img src="images/aprime.jpeg" alt="" height="3%" width="3%" style="float:left;padding-right: 10px;"><a href="https://aprime.io/">APrime Technology</a>&emsp;Senior Software Engineer&emsp;2022-Present</p>
									<p>
										During my time at APrime, I was a consultant that focused primarily on data engineering and devops.  
										During my time consulting, I worked with companies ranging from pre-seed funding all the way through Series 
										B companies across industries including ETF investmenting, usage-based billing platforms, benefits 
										reimbursal, and many others.  For larger companies I worked embedded in existing engineering teams and 
										for smaller companies I worked more greenfield suggesting and implementing best practices.  Because of this, 
										I worked with a wide-range of different technologies and languages that addressed problems such as running a 
										a GCP to AWS cloud migration, full private VPC migration, in-place kubernetes upgrades, custom Go based 
										migration tool, full end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Prefect and R, migration of AWS Step 
										Functions to Dagster, deployment of Argo Rollouts and ArgoCD, and others.

									<p>
										My title at the New York Times is a bit wordy, but I, essentially, worked on the machine learning platform 
										team that was in charge of serving all recommendations to end users.  This includes things like recommending 
										articles that a user might like, generating a top-5 of articles to read for a user, and creating a newsletter 
										to drive users to the frontpage.  I focused mostly on revamping the CI/CD process during this time to reduce 
										deploy times as well as migrating our kubernetes cluster to a service mesh to allow for shadow and canary 
										deployments.<br>
										Our endpoints received thousands of requests per second and we had a SLA of around 100 milliseconds to return 
										a response to the internal gateway API.  Given this, all of our models were written and experimented in Python 
										but then subsequently translated into Golang to provide the best latency possible.

									<p>
										I worked in a number of different roles at Bark, but I started as a data scientist and worked my up to a machine 
										learning engineer.  This meant that I started off working on our recommendation engine that we used to try and get 
										users to add extra products to their monthly shipments.  But, this also spun off into projects including trying 
										to predict an estimated time of delivery and running survival analysis on our subscribers.  Over time, though, 
										I need to work further and further back in the stack and started shifting my focus from just the model but to the 
										whole model lifecycle (i.e. how do we deploy, monitor, and update models safely).  This involved standardizing all 
										of our model training using KubeFlow (on GCP) to deploying models with TensorFlow Serving.<br>
										Of course, there were a number of other projects that came up, as is common in any startup.  I migrated our MongoDB 
										instance to Amazon Redshift, did some causal analysis to try and determine the effectives of our interventions in 
										preventing subscriber churn, improved our sampling weighting to better capture a stratified random sample for our 
										NPS survey, and creating a microservice to deploy our predictions rather than running everything as a batch process.

									<p>
										We were focused here on doing lots of image segmentation, image processing, and time-series analysis to try and 
										predict upcoming fashion trends for clients.  Most of my time here was spent on improving our implementation of the 
										Yolo algorithm we were using for image segmentation and also looking at how we can combine a bunch of different 
										model outputs (i.e. keyword search trends, NLP text extractions, and image vectors) into one singular usable score 
										for our clients to action upon.
